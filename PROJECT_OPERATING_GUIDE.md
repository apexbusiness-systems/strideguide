# StrideGuide - Project Operating Guide

## Mission Statement
Build the world's most trusted offline-first seeing-eye assistant for seniors and blind users, starting in Canada (EN/FR) and expanding globally.

## Core Principles

### Offline-First Architecture
- **Safety-critical flows**: Must work without internet connectivity
- **Privacy by design**: No camera frames leave device under any circumstances
- **Local processing**: All vision inference happens on-device via TensorFlow Lite/Core ML
- **Emergency resilience**: SOS and fall detection function in airplane mode (cellular-only)

### Accessibility Standards (WCAG 2.2 AA+)
- **Touch targets**: Minimum 52dp/pt (exceeds WCAG requirement)
- **Screen readers**: 100% VoiceOver/TalkBack compatibility with proper ARIA labeling
- **Color contrast**: Minimum AA, targeting AAA for text elements
- **Haptic feedback**: Confirmation taps, strong patterns for "Stop!" alerts, SOS countdown
- **Focus management**: Logical tab order, visible focus indicators
- **Motor accessibility**: Supports switch control and voice commands

## Product Tiers & Gating

### Free Tier Constraints
- **Daily limit**: 2 hours active guidance time (countdown during camera processing only)
- **Night mode**: Locked with TTS announcement explaining Premium requirement
- **Usage reset**: Daily at midnight local time
- **Limit behavior**: Guidance pauses, bilingual TTS notice + upgrade CTA

### Premium Tier ($28.99/month)

### Emergency Record Mode (ERM)
- **Ring Buffer**: 2-5 minute pre-event storage in encrypted segments
- **Video Format**: 720p MP4 segments via AVAssetWriter (iOS) / MediaRecorder (Android)
- **Audio Format**: Mono 16kHz when permitted by jurisdiction
- **Encryption**: AES-GCM with device keystore/keychain key management
- **Triggers**: Fall detection, SOS activation, manual button, voice command ("StrideGuide, record"), triple volume press
- **Policy Engine**: Region-aware consent and indicator requirements
- **Storage**: Local only, excluded from cloud backups, biometric Evidence Locker
- **Cleanup**: Automatic deletion per retention policy, safe cryptographic wipe

## Internationalization (i18n)

### Language Support
- **Primary**: English (Canada), French (Canada)
- **Future**: English (US), French (France), Spanish (US)
- **String externalization**: All user-facing text in JSON locale files
- **TTS parity**: Equal voice quality and pronunciation accuracy
- **Cultural adaptation**: Emergency contact formats, metric units, currency

### Localization Requirements
- Date/time formats per locale
- Emergency phone number formats (xxx-xxx-xxxx vs +1-xxx-xxx-xxxx)
- Metric measurements throughout (meters, celsius, kilometers)
- Currency display for subscription pricing
- Right-to-left text support preparation (future Arabic/Hebrew)

## Quality Gates & Testing
